# Introduction:
This project aims to leverage the power of machine learning algorithms to predict the occurrence of kyphosis, a spinal disorder often associated with bone cancer.

Kyphosis, characterized by an abnormal curvature of the spine, can have significant impacts on an individual's quality of life, especially when coupled with underlying conditions such as cancer.

Early detection and accurate prediction of kyphosis development are crucial for timely intervention and effective management of the condition. 

Traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on manual assessment and radiographic imaging, which can be time-consuming and subjective. 

By harnessing the capabilities of machine learning, we strive to enhance the predictive accuracy and efficiency of kyphosis diagnosis.
